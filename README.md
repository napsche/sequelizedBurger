Eat-Da-Burger!

https://napsche.github.io/burger/

For this application, the goal is to allow the user to add burgers they would like to eat. The front end will display existing burgers, and add new burgers that the user would like to eat.

In this application, we use a variety of technologies including JavaScript, Node, Express, Handlebars, etc; 

We use the server.js file to hold the dependencies of the application. We use a GET request to retrieve burgers, POST request to add new burgers, and a PUT request to change the status of the burgers. Handlebars are used to handle data responses from server queries.
